# Advanced Network Intelligence Scanner

A modular Python platform for local network reconnaissance, risk assessment, CVE intelligence, report generation, and a live web dashboard. Designed for authorized security testing and lab use.

## Key Capabilities
- Auto-detect local network and discover hosts via ARP
- Multi-threaded TCP port scanning with custom port ranges
- Service banner grabbing and device-type identification
- CVE lookup through NVD keyword search
- Risk scoring (Low/Medium/High) plus per-port weighting
- Topology visualization (NetworkX + Matplotlib)
- Persistent scan history in SQLite with exportable HTML/JSON reports
- Modern Flask dashboard: KPIs, filters (High, Medium, Open Ports, CVE), copy-to-clipboard cards, delete-all, responsive layout

```

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Auto mode (full LAN)
  ```bash
  sudo python main.py --auto
  # Windows: run in elevated shell for ARP
  ```
  - Scan single target
  ```bash
  python main.py -t 192.168.1.10
  ```
- Scan with custom ports
  ```bash
  python main.py -t 192.168.1.10 -p 22,80,443
  ```


## Dashboard
```bash
python dashboard.py
# browse http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
Features: KPI cards, filters (High/Medium/Open Ports/CVE), copy card info, delete-all scans, responsive layout, no-cache rendering.

## Outputs
- `reports/json/report_<ip>.json`
- `reports/html/report_<ip>.html`
- `network_topology.png`
- `scan_history.db` (SQLite)

## Risk Scoring (examples)
- FTP (21): +3
- Telnet (23): +5
- RDP (3389): +4
- SMB (445): +4
Levels: 0�4 Low, 5�9 Medium, 10+ High.

## Ethical Use
For educational labs and authorized assessments only. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.
